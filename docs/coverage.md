# Coverage and pull-request reports

`scripts/test.sh` enforces 80% coverage across unique executable lines in production Swift, including the native interface. Tests and generated test launchers are excluded. Functional tests use the real editor, WebKit and Tinymist; small boundary tests cover protocol framing and text ranges.

`scripts/coverage.py` writes HTML, raw LLVM output and `build/coverage/codecov.lcov`. LCOV uses repository-relative paths, deduplicates file/line records and covers the same production scope as the local gate. Codecov's additional report search, report generation and source-line adjustments are disabled to keep tests out of the report and preserve the denominator.

## GitHub and Codecov

- PR and main CI upload coverage, including a generated report that fails the local threshold so failures can be investigated.
- Same-repository builds use GitHub OIDC, without a long-lived `CODECOV_TOKEN`. Public fork PRs use Codecov's supported tokenless upload.
- `codecov.yml` requires 80% project and patch coverage and updates one PR comment with overall changes, changed-line coverage and file details.
- The README badge and [Codecov page](https://app.codecov.io/github/fenjin-ai/sumi) show main coverage. Raw data and HTML remain in the Actions `coverage-macos-15` artifact.

The Codecov GitHub App is authorized only for `fenjin-ai/sumi` to read commits, update checks and comment on PRs. Installation and coverage upload are separate steps. Verification requires checking a real PR for both comments and statuses. A first PR without a main baseline may show onboarding information until a main upload establishes comparisons.

## Verification record

On 2026-10-01 the app installation was limited to `fenjin-ai/sumi`. [The initial PR](https://github.com/fenjin-ai/sumi/pull/1) uploaded through GitHub OIDC without a Codecov token. Independent comparison of the platform report and downloaded LCOV matched: 21 production files, 2,107 of 2,442 unique executable lines, **86.28%**. This validates those two outputs from that run; later coverage is specific to its commit.

After main established a baseline, subsequent PRs displayed numeric comparisons and checks. See [PR #2's coverage comment](https://github.com/fenjin-ai/sumi/pull/2#issuecomment-5926250299).
